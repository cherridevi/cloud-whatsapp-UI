##Meta Cloud WhatsApp API Integration
This project integrates Meta's WhatsApp Cloud API for sending and receiving WhatsApp messages programmatically. The system allows you to interact with WhatsApp through APIs, providing a backend service that can be used for automation, customer communication, and more.

###Features
Send WhatsApp messages via the Meta Cloud API.
Receive and handle incoming WhatsApp messages.
Works alongside WhatsApp Web for easier message viewing.
Message logging for tracking communication.
###Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

A Meta Developer Account with access to the WhatsApp Cloud API.
An API Key generated from the Meta Developer Dashboard.
Node.js (or your chosen backend language) installed.
A verified phone number connected to your WhatsApp Cloud account.

###WhatsApp Web Integration
While using the API, you can also view your messages directly in WhatsApp Web. However, note that all automation is managed via the backend using the Meta Cloud API.

###Troubleshooting
API Key Not Working: Ensure you have the correct key and that it's valid for your WhatsApp Business account.
Receiving Messages: Check that your webhook URL is correctly set up in the Meta Developer Console and reachable from the internet.
